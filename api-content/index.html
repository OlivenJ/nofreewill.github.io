I am a Master student majoring in Economics at Duke University, living in beautiful Durham, North Carolina. I will graduate in May 2023, and now, I am actively looking for data analysis, data science, business analysis, or other related positions. üè´Personal Background Born and raised in China, I was lived and educated in both United State and Australia. My academic interest covered broad topics including finance, economics, and statistics. Being able to live in multiple different countries and cities forged my adaptivity Before joining Duke, I obtained a Bachelor of Commerce with Honours degree from Monash Univesity, majoring in Econometrics and Finance. I enjoy building statistical models. Models are an elegant way to explain the world. It brings me joy when identifying a new factor that plays significantly. üíºProfessional Experience My main professional experiences are focusing on investment, which provides me with a unique business prospect most data analysts and data scientists do not have. This will help me to provide better insights and suggestions to the company's marketing, operations, and other teams. üõ† Skills My language of preference is R. In my opinio, R is an powerful, flexible and fun language to use, especially with the tidyverse framework. As a learner who can not get enough with new knoledge and skills, I taught myself to be a fluence Python users. I also taught myself SQL and tablau. Know, I am learning Java and want to become a fullstack developer in 5 years. I am also familar with Excel and VBA, which I think is a undervalued data analysis tool for ordinary people. R: tidyverse,tidymodel, ggplot2, caret,glmnet, Python: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, scikt-learn Java: Data Structure, OOP Machine Learning: linear model, logistic model, peanlized linear model, decision tree, boosting, SVM, KNN Statistical Modeling: ARIMA model, GARCH model, Bayesian Statistics, Panel data analysis, fixed effect and Random effect model, difference in difference model üéä Fun Facts ","link":"https://olivenj.github.io/post/about/"}]}
