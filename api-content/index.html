I am a Master student majoring in Economics at Duke University, living in beautiful Durham, North Carolina. I will graduate in May 2023, and now, I am actively looking for data analysis, data science, business analysis, or other related positions. üè´Personal Background Born and raised in China, I was educated in both United State and Australia. My academic interest covered broad topics including finance, economics, and statistics. Before joining Duke, I obtained a Bachelor of Commerce with Honours degree from Monash Univesity, majoring in Econometrics and Finance. I enjoy building statistical models. Models is an elegant way to explain the world. It brings me joy when identifying a new factor that plays significantly. üíºProfessional Experience My main professional experiences are focusing on investment, which provides me with a unique business prospect most data analysts and data scientists do not have. This will help me to provide better insights and suggestions to the company's marketing, operations, and other teams. üõ† Skills My language of preference is R. In my opinio, R is an powerful, flexible and fun language to use, especially with the tidyverse framework. As a learner who can not get enough with new knoledge and skills, I taught myself to be a fluence Python users. I also taught myself SQL and tablau. Know, I am learning Java and want to become a fullstack developer in 5 years. I am also familar with Excel and VBA, which I think is a undervalued data analysis tool for ordinary people. R: tidyverse,tidymodel, ggplot2, caret,glmnet, Python: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, scikt-learn Java: Data Structure, OOP Machine Learning: linear model, logistic model, peanlized linear model, decision tree, boosting, SVM, KNN Statistical Modeling: ARIMA model, GARCH model, Bayesian Statistics, Panel data analysis, fixed effect and Random effect model, difference in difference model üéä Fun Facts ","link":"https://olivenj.github.io/post/about/"}]}
