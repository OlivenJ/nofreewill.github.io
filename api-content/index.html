My academic interest covered broad topics including finance, economics, and statistics. Before joining Duke, I obtained a Bachelor of Commerce with Honours degree from Monash Univesity, majoring in Econometrics and Finance. I enjoy building statistical models. For me, it is an elegant way to explain the world and I can not wait to use what I know to explore. üíºProfessional Experience My main professional experiences are focusing on investment, which provides me with a unique business prospect most data analysts and data scientists do not have. This will help me to provide better insights and suggestions to the company's marketing, operations, and other teams. üõ† Skills My language of preference is R.
